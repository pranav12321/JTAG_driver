# JTAG Boundary Scan driver
Attempt to write a JTAG driver for performing boundary scan tests on PCBs.

***Roadmap:***
 - Plan to include support for the standard JTAG protocol confirming to **IEEE 1149** standard. 
 - Collect **Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL)** files for various MCUs and implement generic support to perform a boundary scan given the BSDL parameters.
